# Pokemon Game (OOP)
Beta version of my first python project during self-learning of python language and pygame library. I investigate the pygame documention and develop a 2D game where the main characters are pokemons whos able to run , fight , jump , shoot , die and even catch other pokemon (who became main characters also ). 
I saw it as appropriate to learn from the brain and the fingers, so I built a game project with the Pygame library.


Even before I knew architecture, an orderly folder structure with basic knowledge of intricacies and not to mention code editors (I wrote everything in one file! With the basic IDLE without automatic completions)
Needless to say, I am neither a graphic artist nor an animator, I tried not to mess with the design, but some of the pictures, including 
animations, I built from scratch and a smaller part I just edited

Today, a year and a half later, I also managed to pass with honors the certification of an Appleseeds Fullstack bootcamp, including dozens of other amazing projects
Which are stored in my portfolio

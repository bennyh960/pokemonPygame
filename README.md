# pokemonPygame
Beta version of my first pygame project.

The project started during my learning the python languge and i excresie with this project.
I still have a lot of work in the logic ,code view ,fixing bugs and the game features.
Code view - i want to reduce the amount of line by 30% 
      example : the game loop very massy in my opinion and hard to maintin.
Logic - will apllyied by fixing the code view , 
      example : will use in text files in order to import data from net instead creat it by myself.
fixing bugs - TODO list (not uplaoded yet in github)
Game fatures - TODO list(not uploaded yet in github)

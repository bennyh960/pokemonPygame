# Pokemon Game (OOP)
Beta version of my first python project during self-learning of python language and pygame library. I investigate the pygame documention and develop a 2D game where the main characters are pokemons whos able to run , fight , jump , shoot , die and even catch other pokemon (who became main characters also ). 

## Pygame

## Game functionality:
* Multy levels including different code to build levels in UI .
* Evolving and increasing pokemon strength.
* Animation .
* Differents Whethear conditions.
* Enemies AI whos became friends and join to user quest.

## TODO
